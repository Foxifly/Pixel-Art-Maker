# Pixel Art Maker
#### Lindsay Ciastko

## Introduction
This Pixel Art Maker project was designed for the Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship. The purpose of this project was to create an browser application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and/or JQuery. 

## Features
My project had some additional features that weren't originally required in the rubric from Udacity. I added additional features for the project, and integrated it all together. Some of the features of this Pixel Art maker include: 
* Color sliders and a quick color selector
* Height and width sliders
* Eraser pen for undoing pixels
* Show/Hide grid tool
* Save drawing functionality
* clear canvas functionality

## Usage
To run this project locally, download or clone this repository. After downloading, double click (or open with your browser) `index.html` and you can create a canvas and start drawing.
